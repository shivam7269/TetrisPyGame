Our changes include changing the algorithm for rotation of the shapes to one using a circular linked list, which results in lower time complexity but greater space complexity. We've also included a highscore recording function utilising a textfile for storage..

Controls(keyboard):

Up - rotate shape anticlockwise
Down - move shape down a little faster
Left - move shape one step left
Right -move shape one step right
P- Pause
Enter - InstaDrop
